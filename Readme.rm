The provided code is part of a C++ project that appears to be related to solving a problem involving nodes and arcs, possibly for a transportation or logistics application. Here is a brief analysis of the key components:

1. **Node Class (`Node.h` and `Node.cpp`)**:
   - Represents a point in the graph with an ID, type (Depot, Customer, ChargingStation), coordinates (x, y), and service time.
   - Constructor initializes these attributes.

2. **Arc Class (`Arc.h` and `Arc.cpp`)**:
   - Represents a connection between two nodes with attributes for the start node (`from`), end node (`to`), distance, travel time, wireless charging capability, and effective charging rate.
   - Constructor initializes these attributes.

3. **Graph Class (`Graph.h` and `Graph.cpp`)**:
   - Manages a collection of nodes and arcs.
   - Provides methods to add nodes and arcs to the graph.
   - Includes a method to compute the distance between two nodes using the Euclidean distance formula.

4. **Solution Class (`Solution.cpp`)**:
   - The implementation is not fully provided, but it likely represents a solution to the problem being solved.

5. **CMake Configuration (`CMakeLists.txt`)**:
   - Configures the build system for the project.
   - Specifies the C++ standard, includes directories for header files, and links to necessary libraries.
   - Lists all source files and creates an executable from them.

6. **Main Program (`main.cpp`)**:
   - The main function creates an instance of the problem, initializes data, creates solvers, solves the problem using different solvers, and outputs the solutions.

This project seems to be structured to solve a specific problem using various solvers, with a focus on nodes and arcs in a graph. The CMake configuration ensures that all necessary files are included and linked correctly for building the project.
